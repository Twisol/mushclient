    git commit -am "Final changes before release"
    git push

4. Run the updated "git diff" and "git log" commands, pasting the results into the announcement
5. Update the size of the installer (eg. from 2.79 Mb to 2.80 Mb)
6. Update the MD5sum hex figure in the announcement
7. Amend the "improvements" lines in the announcement to reflect the major changes
